## Task

Imagine you are hired by a major video game firm that wants to increase the sales of its products. The developer really wants to develop a popular video game to increase its reputation and hopefully also increase its sales and profits.

Specifically, the client asks you analyze a few specific things.

1.  Consider what variables, if any, have changed over time. Think about the reasons that a factor you examine did or did not change over time.
2.  Consider which genres tend to have the most played video games
2.  Create a regression model to consider what factors are most important in predicting `Plays` of a video game
3.  Consider what lurking variables you may be missing or might change your analysis if you had access to them.

Finally, your client asks you to make a series of recommendations for the type of video game, that, based on the data, the firm should pursue for its next game.

## Specific requirements

-   Save this document as a new document (Save As...) and rename it `Video game report`.
-   Rename the title of your report to `Video game report`
-   Delete the `Assignment instructions`, `Task`, `Specific requirements` and `Points of emphases` sections
-   Final report should be minimum 1500 words
    -   Maximum 8 graphs
      -   Graphs can be combined and only counted as one as long as they are the same type - a combined plot of histograms of predictor variables, for example
    -   Maximum 4 tables
-   Suggested structure:
    -   Introduction & literature review
    -   Time trends
    -   Popularity model
        -   Summary statistics
        -   Regression model
        -   Regression diagnostics
        -   Interpreting coefficients
    -   Conclusion

The definition of the variables can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023).

***There will be a midterm check to make sure you are making good progress due Monday, April 10th at 11:59:00 pm***

You need to submit a relatively finished version for the first two sections (`Introduction & literature review` and `Time trends`) by the Monday deadline. The grade will be pass/fail. The submitted check does not have to be in its final form (you can modify it later if you choose) or be polished (some shown code / text not formatted perfectly is OK).

However, both sections should be substantially complete - all code necessary to fulfill the requirements of the section included and all text necessary to meet the requirements written.

***Final version will be due Sunday, April 16th at 11:59:00***

> Please make sure to submit all the files for this report in one .zip file, include the .qmd, .html, and any files generated when rendering the report

## Points of emphasis

-   Your job as an analyst is to write a report analyzing what factors you think lead to a lot of plays for a video game. The report should be a polished document you are proud to present to a client. The writing should be business professional, the document neat and tidy. Advice on how to write a business report can be found [here](https://library.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/1924160/Business_Reports.pdf).

-   You should transform the `Genres` variable into many categorical variables. You can do this by, for example:

```
video.games <- video.games %>% 
  mutate(adventure = ifelse(grepl("Adventure", Genres), "yes", "no"))
```

-   You only need to consider the top 10-15 most popular genres

-   For the genre analysis, a simple table or bar/boxplot summarizing your findings would be sufficient. Think about which data display would be most meaningful and informative.

-   For the played model, you should limit your focus to one response variable and maximum 4-5 predictor variables that you think are most important in your analyses. You can consider multiple, related models if you wish - models that share most predictor variables but differ by one or two minor variables.

-   Whether a variable should be included in your model or not should be based on whether the variable is important in evaluating the client demand. You should cite a source or two so as to better help you develop some expectations and select the variables that you include in your analysis.

-   Do not exclude a variable just because it initially does not meet the regression requirements if it is substantively important. However, consider carefully whether some variables are actually highly related to another predictor variable -- do not include several measures of the same basic concept (collinearity). In general, you want to start by picking the variables you think matter the most in determining popularity and then work to try to understand their relationship to popularity.

-   You should focus your graphs and tables on that illustrating the most important information for drawing your conclusion. Choose your tables carefully such that they convey the key information needed to arrive at your conclusion. Do not make tables and graphs of irrelevant information or points that do not need discussing. Multiple graphs of the same type (for example, distribution plots) can be combined using the `gridExtra` package, but unrelated plots should be listed separately.

-   Make sure to also interpret the coefficients. You need to interpret the impact of a one unit change in the predictor variable on the response variable. You additionally need to examine whether changes in the predictor variables lead to a substantively large or small change in the predictor variable. One way to do this is examining whether changing the predictor variable from its Q1 to Q3 value leads to a large or small change in the response variable. You may want to make a table with this information.

# Introduction and literature review

Discuss what your expectations are here and how you arrived at your expectation, including the source of your expectation.

# Time trends

Consider how to display and discuss any significant trend you noticed across time, including any summary statistics and important graphical displays to answer these questions

# Genre report

Here you will report on which genres seem to have the most played games. Think carefully about why this may be the case. Only one data display is necessary here but think carefully about which kind of display will best summarize your findings.

# Popularity model

In this section you will fully develop a model of the number of times a video game is played. 

## Summary data

Discuss summary data of the key variables in the dataset.

## Regression model

State clearly what your proposed model is and why you selected the relevant predictor variables.

## Regression diagnostics

Check to see how well your model fits the data here.

## Interpreting coefficients

Interpret the magnitude of your coefficients here. 

# Conclusion

Add conclusion and recommendations here. Note also any limitations of your analysis and what other forms of advanced analysis could be conducted to strengthen the analysis in the future.
