Error$?\n\n```{r picker1, exercise=TRUE}\nsample(classroster$name, 1)\n```\n\n### Model\n\n* The equation of the least squares line $\\hat{mpg} = 46.32−15.35\\times weight$\n* Slope of -15.35 indicates that the miles per gallon of cars is on average 15.35 less for each additional ton the car weighs.\n* How useful is the model?\n* Slope and intercept are descriptions of data - want to know how certain we are of this slope estimate\n* Want to understand what it can tell us beyond the 400 cars in the study\n* Construct CI, test hypotheses about slope, intercept\n\n### Sample vs. model regression\n\n* Sample:  \n  + $\\hat{y}=b_0 + b_1x$\n  + This gives a prediction for $y$ based on the sample.\n* Model:   \n  + $\\mu_y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x$\n  + $b_0$ = y-intercept for the model\n  + $b_1$ = slope for the model\n  + The model assumes that for every value of $x$, the mean of the $y$'s lies on the line.\n\n```{r out.width=\"100%\", fig.cap=\"Slope variability\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/slope.variability.png\")\n```\n\nJust as with a mean, if we sample many times from a population, we will, by chance, get variation in our estimate of the slope of the relationship between the two variables. \n\n```{r manysamples, exercise=TRUE}\nmany_samples <- auto.mpg %>% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 50)\n\nggplot(many_samples) + \n  # Add a point layer\n  geom_point(data=auto.mpg, aes(x=weight.tons, y=mpg)) + \n  # Add a smooth trend layer, using lin. reg., no ribbon\n  geom_smooth(aes(x=weight.tons, y=mpg, group=replicate), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  geom_smooth(data=auto.mpg, aes(x=weight.tons, y=mpg), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"red\") +\n  labs(x=\"Weight in tons\", y=\"Miles per gallon\")\n```\n\nWe can then make a histogram of each of these slope estimates.\n\n```{r manyhistograms, exercise=TRUE}\nmany_samples <- auto.mpg %>% rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 50)\n\nmany_lms <- many_samples %>% \n  group_by(replicate) %>% \n  do(lm(mpg ~ weight.tons, data=.) %>% tidy()) %>%\n  filter(term == \"weight.tons\")\n\n# Using many_lms, plot estimate\nggplot(many_lms, aes(x=estimate)) +\n  # Add a histogram layer\n  geom_histogram(fill=\"blue4\") +\n  labs(x=\"Slope estimate\", y=\"Count\")\n```\n\nIn expectation, what shape should we expect the distribution of slope estimates to conform to?

Check Straight Enough Condition with scatterplot.\n2. Fit regression, find predicted values and residuals.\n3. Make scatterplot of residuals and check for thickening, bends, and outliers.\n4. For data measured over time, use residuals plot to check for independence.\n5. Check the Nearly Normal Condition with a histogram and Normal plot of residuals.\n6. If no violations, proceed with inference.\n\n* Note: Stop if at any point there is a violation.\n\n## Sampling distribution of models\n\n### Sample to sample variation of the slope and intercept\n\n* Null hypothesis (usually) - regression slope = 0\n  + $H_0: b_1 = 0$\n  + $H_a: b1 \\neq 0$\n\n* $p$ values in the table come from tests of this hypothesis for each coefficient.\n* To calculate $p$ value, we need to describe our sampling distribution. \n* The mean of the sampling distribution of the regression slope will be 0, from the null hypothesis.\n* We assume shape of the sampling distribution will be normal (from the Central Limit Theorem)\n* Standard errors (or our estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution) must come from the data.\n* Each sample of 400 cars will produce its own line with slightly different $b_0$’s and $b_1$’s.\n\n### Spread around the line\n\n* Less scatter along the line $\\rightarrow$ slope more consistent\n* Residual standard deviation, $s_e$, measures this scatter.\n\n```{r out.width=\"100%\", fig.cap=\"Spread around the line\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/regression.scatter.png\")\n```\n\n* Less scatter around the line, smaller the residual standard deviation and stronger the relationship between $x$ and $y$\n* Some assess strength of regression by looking at $s_e$\n* It has the same units as $y$\n* Tells how close data are to the our model.\n* $r^2$ is proportion of the variation of $y$ accounted for by $x$\n\n```{r modelresults, exercise=TRUE}\nsummary(lmodel)\n```\n\n* Larger $s_x$ (SD in $x$) $\\rightarrow$ more stable regression\n\n```{r out.width=\"100%\", fig.cap=\"Spread in x's\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/regression.stability.png\")\n```\n\n### Sample size\n\n* Larger sample size $\\rightarrow$ more stable regression\n\n```{r out.width=\"100%\", fig.cap=\"Sample size stability\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/regression.sample.size.png\")\n```\n\n### Standard error for the slope\n\n* Three aspects of the scatterplot, then, affect the standard error of the regression slope: \n  + Spread around the model: $s_e$\n  + Variation among the $x$ values.\n  + Sample size: $n$ \n* These are in fact the **only** things that affect the standard error of the slope.\n\n### Standard error formally\n\n* The standard error for the slope parameter is estimated by:\n  + $SE(b_1) = \\frac{s_e}{\\sqrt{n-1}s_x}$ where $s_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(y-\\hat{y})^2}}{n-2}}$\n\n* We can then calculate how many $t$ units our slope estimate is from the null hypothesis by:\n  + $t=\\frac{b_1-\\beta_1}{SE(b_1)}$\n  + The $t$ follows Student's $t$ model with $df=n-2$\n\n* Don't need to remember the SE formula, just note that the process is exactly the same as for the mean\n  + Find the number of $t$ units the slope is away from the mean\n  + Use that $t$ score to find a $p$ value of how likely it would be to observe a difference in slopes that larger or larger from the null just by chance\n\n## Inference for regression\n  \n### Example - wages\n\n* It has long been known women earn less than men, and this fact is often taken as evidence of discrimination\n* How to test with statistics though?\n\n```{r out.width=\"100%\", fig.cap=\"Gender wage gap\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/wage.gap.png\")\n```\n\n### What about a $t$ test?\n\n* Slam dunk case right??\n\n```{r wagettest, exercise=TRUE}\nt.test(wages$wage[wages$sex==\"Male\"], wages$wage[wages$sex==\"Female\"])\n```\n\nWhat are some reasons why this $t$ test might be misleading?\n\n```{r picker4, exercise=TRUE}\nsample(classroster$name, 1)\n```\n\n### Other factors\n\n* Women dropping out of the labor force\n* Impact of high earning men influencing the calculation (outliers)\n* Women's career choice\n* Differences in educational attainment\n* Other factors?\n\n### 1. Check straight enough condition\n\nTwo-way scatterplots\n\n```{r wageconditioncheck1, exercise=TRUE}\nplot1 <- ggplot(wages, aes(x=exp, y=wage, color=sex)) +\n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\") +\n  labs(x=\"Experience\", y=\"Wage\")\n\nplot2 <- ggplot(wages, aes(x=ed, y=wage, color=sex)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  labs(x=\"Education\", y=\"Wage\")\n\ngrid.arrange(plot1, plot2)\n```\n\nHistogram of wage\n\n```{r wageconditioncheck2, exercise=TRUE}\nggplot(wages, aes(x=wage)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill=\"blue4\", color=\"black\") +\n  labs(x=\"Wage\", y=\"Count\")\n```\n\nHistogram of log(wage)\n\n```{r wageconditioncheck3, exercise=TRUE}\nggplot(wages, aes(x=lwage)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill=\"blue4\", color=\"black\") +\n  labs(x=\"Log wage\", y=\"Count\")\n```\n\nDo these plots suggest the straight enough condition has been met?\n\n```{r picker5, exercise=TRUE}\nsample(classroster$name, 1)\n```\n\n### 2. Fit the regression\n\n```{r wageconditioncheck4, exercise=TRUE}\nwage.model <- lm(lwage ~ exp + bluecol + ed + sex, data=wages)\n\nsummary(wage.model)\n```\n\nInterpret this regression table.\n\n```{r picker6, exercise=TRUE}\nsample(classroster$name, 1)\n```\n\n### 3.
